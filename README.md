# Tic-Tac-Toe / react

This is my take on the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe built in react!

## Requirements
### MVP
- [x] Board should be empty at start
- [x] Each click should alternate between Xs and Os, starting with X.
- [x] When a player wins or there is a draw, notify the user.

### Extras
- [x] Use React
- [x] Update the UI using CSS or similar framework.
- [x] Add a restart game button
- [ ] Support a NxN board
- [x] Any additional features of my choosing

## Challenges
- I struggled with identifying a 'DRAW'. I originally wrote very simple code to determine this, but found that more comparisons are needed to achieve this.
